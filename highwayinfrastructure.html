Highway Infrastructure Trust is an Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) that will own and operate a portfolio of 5 operational toll roads. Revenue is highly predictable, coming from toll collections and annuity payments from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).[1, 2]</div>

                    <div class="answer-text"><span class="positive">Positive.</span> The trust operates in a sector with strong government backing. Initiatives like the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and Bharatmala Pariyojana ensure a continuous pipeline of new road assets. Toll revenues have built-in escalators (linked to WPI) and grow with traffic volume, which is tied to economic growth.[3, 4]</div>

                    <div class="answer-text"><span class="positive">Positive.</span> The moat is structural. The trust holds long-term concession agreements (average remaining life of 22 years) from NHAI, granting it monopolistic rights to collect tolls on its specific highway stretches. This creates a very strong barrier to entry for the life of the concession.[5]</div>

However, Profit After Tax (PAT) is low and lumpy due to high depreciation and finance costs, which is typical for infrastructure assets. The key metric is cash flow, not PAT.[6]</div>

                    <div class="answer-text"><span class="negative">Negative.</span> As is typical for infrastructure assets, the debt level is high. The post-issue debt-to-equity ratio is expected to be around 1.8x. While this is a risk, SEBI regulations for InvITs cap leverage at 70% of asset value, providing a regulatory ceiling and some comfort to investors.[8]</div>

                    <div class="answer-text"><span class="mixed">Mixed.</span> RoNW is low, at around 8-9%, due to the PAT being suppressed by high depreciation charges.

The underlying assets generate strong, stable, and predictable cash flows from operations. This is the cash that will be used to pay distributions to unitholders semi-annually.

                    <div class="answer-text"><span class="positive">Positive.</span> The issue is a 100% fresh issue of units.
